						<p>Tuesday, October 15th, Room D-120A</p>
						<p>Have you ever written an essay and struggled immensely with the formatting? Do you want to learn more about how to type math formulas efficiently, without going through the struggle of LaTeX? 

							<p>We know that writing about science (and typing math formulas. UGH) can be challenging. Luckily, there is help. We are very excited to welcome <strong>Professor Pierre-Alexandre Mailhot</strong> from the math department, who will present an introduction to <strong>Scientific Writing Using Typst</strong>.
							</p>
							<p><a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>  is open-source software that helps you compose your papers more efficiently. We will also cover the basics of scientific essay writing.</p>

							<h2>DNA Extraction Lab Project [Nov]</h2>
				
							<p><u><b>Sign up here <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJ9QyFKOUJ1LHnC7qCd515OtPryIZiGSNFgDFyB8w9I/edit?usp=sharing">here </a>for the actual lab.</b></u></p>
							
							<h3>Don't Miss MRT's Biggest Event of the Year!</h3>
						
							<p>Are you ready to jumpstart your scientific career? This is your chance to get hands-on experience with a cutting-edge research project! Learn valuable skills that are essential in molecular biology, biomedical research, forensic science, food sciences and other scientific fields. Also, take the chance to have your name on a scientific article that will be published on our website.</p>
						
							<h3>Quick overview of the project</h3>
							<p><strong>Goal :</strong> Determine the DNA yield of different fruit samples and determine the influence of growing conditions on the DNA concentration of these fruits.</p>
						
							<h3>Main Methods :</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>DNA extraction using ethanol precipitation</li>
								<li>Quantitative DNA Concentration Estimation by the Diphenylamine Method</li>
							</ul>
						
							<h3>The lab project will have 2 main parts :</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Experiment and Manipulations</strong>
									<p>You will be getting the main results and data that will be used in the analysis of the article. This first part will have limited spots due to limited place in the lab and limited materials for the experiment. Those who participate the most in earlier activities will have priority.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Writing the article</strong>
									<p>As you analyze the results of your experiments, you'll have the opportunity to craft various sections of your scientific article. This is an excellent way to learn about scientific writing. We will host a series of workshops focused on writing scientific articles. Everyone who participates in the lab project will have their name on the final article published on our website.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						
							<p>We can't wait to see you!</p>
